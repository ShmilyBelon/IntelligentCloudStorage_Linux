PLease input the number of rows(n) and the number of columns(m):

Please input the matrix of coefficients (named C)  you use to encode the data:

Because the number of data sets must equals to m,so...

Please input the data which is a column vector of 4 rows  you wanna encode: 

encode result (5 rows  1 columns)

  152
  153
  180
    6
  165

Now you need to pick m lines of the matrix you've just input to decode the encoded data.
The lines in the matrix are numbered from 1 to n 
The data to input should be in ascending order:
The inverse of the submatrix of C you've just picked:
  185  106  226   16
   43   87   97   11
  136   11  212  196
   27   54   87  223


After decoding:
   34
  243
   19
   90
PLease input the number of rows(n) and the number of columns(m):

Please input the matrix of coefficients (named C)  you use to encode the data:

Because the number of data sets must equals to m,so...

Please input the data which is a column vector of 2 rows  you wanna encode: 

encode result (3 rows  1 columns)

   95
  180
  237

Now you need to pick m lines of the matrix you've just input to decode the encoded data.
The lines in the matrix are numbered from 1 to n 
The data to input should be in ascending order:
The inverse of the submatrix of C you've just picked:
  140  141
  141  141


After decoding:
    6
   89
PLease input the number of rows(n) and the number of columns(m):

real	0m0.020s
user	0m0.009s
sys	0m0.000s
